<h1>About Me</h1>

  <h2>Shannon McGrath</h2> 
  <p>Hello! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I am a Chicago native who has spent the last five years in Idaho, Arizona, Washinton D.C., Illionis, and Utah. I just finished my third year teaching fifth grade. This summer will be my second summer teaching coding with Girls Who Code. 76 degree weather, sunshine, and a light breeze are my kryptonite, I love to be outside. I love hiking, skiing, scuba diving, sailing, wake surfing, and long boarding (but am not particularly great at any of them). I also throroughly enjoy the Ted radio hour, dessert for breakfast, and lame puns.</p>
  <h2>Two Truths and A Lie</h2> 
  <p>Can you spot the lie?<br>I had three sets of front teeth<br>I am double jointed<br>I once danced with Sean Kingston</p>
